Lock Planning

    - thread storage

    - k storage

shouldn't ever need something for this past a certain point because its only modified in the trampoline??? The index, shouldn't change, neither should the scheduler

actually with the k_storage curr id will be changing so maybe something there


- queue



OK so im noticing that all threads are being created by one thread and 
their uc links are all that scheduler. will that have an impact?
